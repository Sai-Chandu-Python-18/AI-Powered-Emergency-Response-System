# AI-Powered-Emergency-Response-System
Product Requirements Document (PRD)
AI-Powered Emergency Response System

For Hospitality Management (Real-Time Health Crisis Detection & Response)
1. Document Overview
1.1 Purpose

This PRD defines the development of an AI-driven emergency response system that detects life-threatening health incidents (e.g., heart attacks, seizures) in hotel guests via wearable devices and room sensors, triggering instant alerts to on-site medical teams while providing guided first-aid support.
1.2 Key Objectives

✔ Early Detection: Identify critical health anomalies in real time.
✔ Rapid Response: Automatically alert medics with guest location/vitals.
✔ First-Aid Support: AI chatbot/video guides bystanders or staff.
✔ Privacy-Centric: Opt-in only; no continuous monitoring without consent.
2. Product Scope
2.1 Features & Functionality
Feature	Description	User Benefit
Wearable Integration	Syncs with guest-permitted smartwatches (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit) to monitor heart rate, SpO₂, fall detection.	Captures vitals without invasive devices.
Room Sensors	Radar/thermal sensors detect falls, irregular movements (e.g., seizure convulsions).	Covers guests without wearables.
Predictive Alerts	AI analyzes trends (e.g., spike in heart rate + plummeting SpO₂ → cardiac arrest risk).	Proactive intervention.
Medic Dispatch	Alerts on-site medical team via app/SMS with room number, vitals, and shortest path.	Reduces response time (<2 mins).
AI First-Aid Guide	Chatbot/video (AR overlay) instructs bystanders: "Begin CPR; defibrillator en route."	Empowers untrained staff.
2.2 Out of Scope

❌ Diagnosing conditions (only alerts based on predefined thresholds).
❌ Replacing 911/EMS (complements local emergency services).
❌ Storing long-term health data (only real-time processing).
3. User Stories & Workflows
3.1 Guest Journey

    Opt-In During Check-In:

        Guest consents to share wearable data or enable room sensors.

        Selects conditions to monitor (e.g., "I have epilepsy; detect seizures.").

    Emergency Detection:

        AI detects seizure-like movements via room radar → verifies with wearable data (elevated heart rate).

        Alerts medic: "Room 1410: Possible seizure. Vitals spiking at 98% confidence."

    Post-Incident:

        System logs anonymized incident data for improvement.

        Guest can request report for personal physician.

3.2 Staff Workflow

    Medic Dashboard: Real-time map of alerts with priority levels.

    AI Co-Pilot: Suggests actions (e.g., "Bring defibrillator; guest has history of arrhythmia.").

4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Tech Stack
Component	Technology	Purpose
Wearable APIs	Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, Withings	Pull heart rate, SpO₂, fall data.
AI/ML Models	LSTM networks (time-series anomaly detection), CNN for motion analysis	Predict strokes/seizures.
Backend	Apache Kafka (real-time data streams), Python (FastAPI)	Process sensor data.
Frontend	Medic PWA (Progressive Web App), Guest mobile app	Alerts and controls.
Hardware	Millimeter-wave radar (e.g., Infineon), Thermal cameras (non-invasive)	Fall/convulsion detection.
4.2 Data & Compliance

🔒 Encryption: End-to-end TLS 1.3 for vitals transmission.
📜 Compliance: HIPAA (if US-based), GDPR (EU), explicit guest consent.
🗑️ Data Retention: Anonymize after 24hrs; store only metadata (e.g., "seizure incident, response time: 1m 42s").
5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

🚨 Response Time: Target <90 seconds from detection to medic arrival.
💡 False Positive Rate: <5% (via model tuning).
🏥 Incident Resolution Rate: % of cases stabilized before EMS arrives.
6. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
False alarms causing panic.	Multi-sensor validation (e.g., radar + wearable + audio distress detection).
Guest privacy lawsuits.	Clear opt-in workflows; granular data permissions.
Hardware failures.	Redundant sensors per room; nightly self-checks.
7. Roadmap

Phase 1 (6 months): Pilot with wearables + basic fall detection in 10 rooms.
Phase 2 (12 months): Integrate predictive analytics (stroke/seizure models).
Phase 3 (18 months): AR first-aid guides + drone-defibrillator partnerships.
